suderman-style dotfiles
=======================

I keep my dotfiles symlinked from ~/.dotfiles to my home directory. I
use [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) to manage them nicely.  

If you're me, open a terminal and run this command:  
`curl https://raw.github.com/suderman/dotfiles/master/install | sh`
